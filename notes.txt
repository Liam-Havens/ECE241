def defines a function
print_to_std_out prints a string on the screen
linear search is slower than binary search
"big O" notations reveals the essence of algorithm performance
    -Defines an upper boundary on complexity growth
 big theta is lower bound
 binary search is ab splitting into lower and upper
 def insertionSort(alist):
    for index in range(1,len(alist)):

Merge sort performance can be improved by using heap sort and quick sort
Heap_________
    -Use heap DS to manage info
    -Make also an efficient priority queue
Binary tree is  branching tree that splits into two paths each time
The top of a binary tree is the root
for arithmetic
2 * i = left child
(2*i) + 1 = right child

to actually find
lc: 2i + 1
rc: 2(i+1)

Min heap
smallest value at top

children dont have to be ordered

heapsort
n log n

build-max-heap
n

max-heapify
lg n

Quick sort
1.Select Pivot value
    -simplify first item in list
    -assist with splitting list
    -split point used to divide list got subsequent calls
